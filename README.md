# Creatsy - Buy and Sell Artiste NFT bonds

A marketplace that allows you to list and sell your NFTs as bonds. A small project to explore the use of smart contacts and how NFTs work.

## Installation

You can fork it and use the source code. Currently on Polygon Mumbai test network so you will have to configure your contract address in config.js.

## Usage

Currently still figuring out the deployment of the app, meanwhile you can take a look at what the website looks like below.
